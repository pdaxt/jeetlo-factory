    "Electronegativity = How badly an atom WANTS electrons",

  "mind_blow": "When Fluorine meets Cesium, the electronegativity difference is so high (3.3) that Cesium basically DONATES its electron!",
  "exam_relevance": "JEE loves: Predict bond polarity using electronegativity. NEET asks: Why HF is a weak acid despite F being most electronegative.",
