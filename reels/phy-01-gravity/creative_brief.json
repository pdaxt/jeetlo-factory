  "core_analogy": "Gravity = Earth is a CLINGY EX who refuses to let you go. The closer you are, the harder they hold on. The more massive they are (emotionally heavy), the stronger their grip. You can run to the moon but they'll STILL pull at you, just weaker.",
  "subconscious_hook": "Identity challenge + curiosity gap. 'You're falling RIGHT NOW' attacks their sense of reality. Creates instant cognitive dissonance - 'Wait, I'm sitting still, how am I falling?' They MUST keep watching to resolve the mental itch.",

    "01_hook": "Person sitting on couch, suddenly the 'floor' becomes transparent revealing Earth below. Zoom out to show them actually falling TOWARD Earth's center. Big red arrow pointing down. Text: 'You're FALLING right now'",

    "03_content_part2": "FieldVisualizer showing gravity field lines around Earth like a spider web. Person at different distances - close (strong pull, dense lines), far (weak pull, sparse lines). Numbers showing actual force values.",
    "04_reveal": "Zoom out from Earth to show Moon also 'falling' toward Earth but missing because it's moving sideways. Draw the curved path. 'Orbiting IS falling. You just keep MISSING the ground!' Mind-explosion animation.",
    "05_key_point": "MechanicsSimulator showing inverse square relationship. Distance doubles \u2192 force becomes 1/4. Visual: Four identical weights at 1x distance become one weight at 2x distance. 'Square that r. SQUARE IT.'",
    "06_exam_tip": "JEE question flash: 'At what height is g = g\u2080/4?' Answer appears: 'r = 2R (one Earth radius above surface)'. Common mistake highlighted in red: 'NOT 4R from center!'",

  "virality_factor": "The 'orbiting is just falling and missing' revelation. People will screenshot this to show friends. Also the 'clingy ex' analogy is memorable and shareable - students will use this in their friend groups.",
  "mind_blow_moment": "The Moon is FALLING toward Earth every single second - it just moves sideways fast enough to keep missing. Orbit = perpetual fall. This reframes everything they thought about 'floating' in space.",
