  "core_analogy": "Electronegativity = Tug-of-War strength. Fluorine is the undefeated champion wrestler who ALWAYS wins the electron rope. When two atoms share electrons, the stronger wrestler pulls the electron blanket towards themselves, leaving the other atom cold and partially positive.",

    "02_setup": "Zoom out to show periodic table with electronegativity values as 'power levels' like a video game. Fluorine glows brightest (4.0). Show a tug-of-war rope appearing between two atoms. Question mark appears: 'But what happens when atoms share electrons?'",

Show \u03b4+ on H, \u03b4- on F with arrow pointing towards F. Animate the 'dipole moment' as an arrow showing electron pull direction. Label: 'Polar bond - unequal sharing'. Duration: 10s",
    "03_content_part3": "Scene 3: Na-F bond (complete robbery). F wrestler is SO strong, it rips the electron completely away from Na. Na flies backward, now showing +1 charge. F holds electron triumphantly with -1 charge. Label: 'Ionic bond - electron transfer'. Duration: 8s",
    "04_reveal": "Mind-blow visual: Show electronegativity difference scale as a 'relationship status'. 0-0.4 = 'Best friends sharing equally' (non-polar). 0.5-1.7 = 'One friend always borrows your stuff' (polar). >1.7 = 'They STOLE your stuff' (ionic).

F(4.0)-H(2.1)=1.9 vs Cl(3.0)-H(2.1)=0.9. HF wins! But trick: HF is actually considered ionic by some definitions. Examiner's favorite confusion point.",

  "virality_factor": "The tug-of-war wrestling analogy is HIGHLY shareable because: 1) It's visually memorable and funny (tiny H vs massive F), 2) The '1.7 rule' is a screenshot-worthy hack that students will save, 3) The 'relationship status' comparison (sharing vs stealing) is relatable and meme-able. Students will share saying 'This is how I finally understood polarity!'",
  "mind_blow_moment": "The realization that ALL bonds exist on a SPECTRUM from pure sharing to pure stealing - and the electronegativity difference is just measuring 'how unfair is this friendship?' The 1.7 threshold isn't magic, it's where sharing becomes so unequal it's basically theft.",

Dipole moment = direction of unfairness. Ionic vs covalent = sharing vs stealing. Numbers (4.0, 2.1, 1.7) are introduced as 'power levels' in a game, not abstract values.
